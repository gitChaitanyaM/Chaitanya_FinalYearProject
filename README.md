# Chaitanya_FinalYearProject
A Company Reporting System generating reports which are required by company
management to know the performance of the organization’s various departments as
as well as employees. It makes the decision making process faster.
Decision makers need real time information/updates to take effective decisions and
A reporting system helps to achieve this goal.
On my website I will try to organize the data and display those as per user’s request.
A user can see this data based on their authority or designation. For e.g. if Mr. Arun
works as a normal employee, system will display him different data and if Mr. Vasant
works as a Manager then the system shows him different data. Reporting system will
show data as per users department also as per his/her designation.
My aim throughout the project is to make the website user friendly and elegant and
also I am trying to make the website device friendly.
The content of the data is changed as per user’s device (for e.g. If a user views a
website on “Desktop” the program calculates device width and display data
accordingly. The same thing happens for “mobile” and “tabs” also.)
